# Shop Approval Workflow - Implementation Complete

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Shop Status System
- Shops now have status: **pending**, **approved**, **rejected**
- Customers stay as customers until shop is approved
- Only approved shops can manage products

### 2. Customer Shop Registration
- Customer creates shop → Status = **pending**
- Customer stays as customer role
- Awaits admin approval

### 3. Super Admin Shop Management Page
- New page: `/admin/shops`
- View all pending, approved, rejected shops
- Approve or reject shops with reasons
- Approve → Owner becomes manager
- Statistics dashboard

### 4. Navbar Updated
- "Manage Shops" link for super-admin
