## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Customer can't create shop

**Check:**
- Profile complete? (photo, phone, CNIC)
- All fields saved?
- Backend running?

### Admin can't see pending shops

**Check:**
- Logged in as super-admin?
- Backend has shops data?
- Check `/api/shops` returns shops

### Approval doesn't upgrade user

**Check:**
- Backend logs for errors
- User refresh/relogin
- Check user role in database
